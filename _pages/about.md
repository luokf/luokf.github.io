Hi there! I am currently a research assistant in Prof. [Xi Dai](http://physics.ust.hk/eng/people_detail.php?pplcat=1&id=431)’s group at HKUST.

In 2018, I attained B.Sc. and graduated summa cum laude from Wuhan University, before which I was being an undergraduate researcher supervised by Prof. [Rui Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wk3pirYAAAAJ&hl=en) for over two years.
