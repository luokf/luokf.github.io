Hi there!

I am a PhD student majoring in Theoretical Physics at UT Austin from spring 2021. Before this, I was an undergraduate researcher at Wuhan University and a research assistant at HKUST for over four years.

Besides continuous passions for natural science, I am now interested in Social Constructionism, Micro-economics and Cognitive Psychology. To understand humankind and natural world motivates my life.
