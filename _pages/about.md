Hi there!

I am currently a research assistant at HKUST, and will be a PhD student at UT-Austin in this fall. Before these, I was being an undergraduate researcher in Wuhan University for around three years.

Besides great passions for natural science, I am also interested in computer, sociology and macro-economics. Knowing myself and thereal world a little more  is one of the most significant motivations of my life.
