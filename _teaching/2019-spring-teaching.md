As a graduate research assistant to Prof. Rui Yu in Spring 2019, I advised two undergraduates to accomplish their thesis developed from my work 'Topologial nodal states in circuit lattice' and 'non-Hermitian exceptional points'.

 - Topological nodal states spring-mass network
 - non-Hermitian system with Higher-order exceptional points and LC lattice realization
