As a graduate research assistant to Prof. Rui Yu in Spring 2019, I advised two seniors to accomplish their thesis developed based on two my work 'Topologial nodal states in circuit lattice' and 'non-Hermitian exceptional points'.

## Topological Spring-Mass Network

TBD.

## Higher-Order Exceptional Points and LC Lattice Realization

TBD.
